I trained the model in the application using only the relationships that contained the "vt_sim" tag. This allows
the model weights to not be uniformly 0 but still very small: https://zepplin.sec.in.tum.de/#/notebook/2C33UQ5N6

Furthermore, I attempted to recreate the JSON output that the system should create here in Zeppelin,
if you scroll at the bottom of this notebook. You can see how the output looks like in JSON.
