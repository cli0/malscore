The values of the algorithms in this thread (more specifically: cluster numbers and iterations) are not the same as in
the paper. The local machine limitations are a restriction for the algorithms. For example, with this dataset I
cannot go higher than 32 clusters with BKM, lest I get a weird error, which can be bypassed with more memory.
